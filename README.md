# Weather_App

That's a great idea! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to create this weather app as a capstone project:

1. Choose a weather API: There are many weather APIs available online.
You can choose one that offers free access and provides all the necessary data, such as OpenWeatherMap, Weather Underground, or Dark Sky.

2. Sign up and get an API key: Once you've selected an API, sign up and get an API key.
This key is necessary to access the data from the API.

3. Set up your development environment: Install Python and any necessary libraries, such as Requests
(to make HTTP requests to the API) and a GUI library like Tkinter or PyQt (to display the data).

4. Make a request to the API: Use the Requests library to make a GET request to the API and retrieve the weather data.
The API should provide the data in JSON format.

5. Parse the JSON data: Use Python's built-in JSON library to parse the
data and extract the relevant information, such as the current temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

6. Display the data: Use your chosen GUI library to display the weather data
in a user-friendly way. You can create a simple interface that shows the current temperature and weather condition, as well as additional information such as the location and time of day.

7. Add additional features: To make your weather app stand out, you can add
additional features such as the ability to search for different locations, display a 5-day forecast, or change the app's background based on the weather condition.

8. Test and debug: Make sure your app is functioning as expected by testing
it with different locations and weather conditions. Debug any errors that arise along the way.

9. Document your project: Once your app is complete, document your project
by writing a brief report that explains the project's purpose, features, and how it was built. Include screenshots of the app and any code snippets that are relevant.

10. Overall, this project is a great way to practice working with APIs, parsing
data, and creating a user-friendly GUI. Good luck and have fun!
